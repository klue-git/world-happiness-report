## Project Brief

**Motivation**

Coming up on the 20.3.2024 is the international day of happiness. This seems like a good time to review the most recent World Happiness Report that has been published first in 2012 and on a yearly basis since 2015. This analysis will review how the covid-19 pandemic that changed many people's lives globally and impacted on their happiness ratings. 


**Objective**

Determine the current happiness rank by country and country rank by the 6 specific factors the WHR identified as contributing to happiness: 
GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption. Identify changes in ratings between the pandemic years (2020 - 2022) and the previous time period (2017 - 2019).

**Context**

[About WHR](https://worldhappiness.report/about/)

The World Happiness Report is a partnership of Gallup, the Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and the WHR’s Editorial Board. The report is produced under the editorial control of the WHR Editorial Board.
The World Happiness Report reviews the state of happiness in the world today and shows how the science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. It reflects a worldwide demand for more attention to happiness and well-being as criteria for government policy.
The World Happiness Report and much of the growing international interest in happiness exist thanks to Bhutan. They sponsored Resolution 65/309, “Happiness: Towards a holistic approach to development,” adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 19 July 2011, inviting national governments to “give more importance to happiness and well-being in determining how to achieve and measure social and economic development.”
On 2 April 2012, chaired by Prime Minister Jigmi Y. Thinley and Jeffrey D. Sachs, the first World Happiness Report was presented to review evidence from the emerging science of happiness for the ‘Defining a New Economic Paradigm: The Report of the High-Level Meeting on Well-being and Happiness.’ On 28 June 2012, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 66/281, proclaiming the 20 March International Day of Happiness to be observed annually. The World Happiness Report is released annually around March 20th as part of the International Day of Happiness celebration.

**Assumptions**

The corona pandemic has impacted on people's lives in regards to happiness ratings since it impacted on several of the explanatory key factors like e.g. 'social support', 'freedom to make life choices' and possibly 'perceptions of corruption' in the sense of a higher mistrust in the government (here the 'Querdenker' movement in Germany comes into mind e.g.)

**Constraints**

The WHR data is limited and is missing observations for certain years and/or countries. Not all countries of the world participate in the polls, participate regularly or participate fully. Certain questions are not part of the polls in certain countries like e.g. “the perception of corruption” question in China.

**Research Hypothesis**

The corona pandemic has impacted on people’s lives in regards to happiness world-wide since it impacted on ‘freedom’ (freedom to make life choices) and potentially ‘corruption’ (perception of corruption/mistrust in the government) as well as potentially on social support → I’m thinking e.g. the ‘Querdenker’ movement in Germany.
Null Hypothesis: The Pandemic years have not significantly changed the happiness scores (especially the freedom, social support and corruption aspect) of any country.
